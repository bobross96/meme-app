# meme-app
Made a meme webapp using imgflip meme api as source

# API Used (Sign up for an imgflip account to get your own username and password)
https://imgflip.com/api


# Steps to deploy 
1) git clone the repo
2) create your own firebase account and setup your own project 
3) firebase init hosting in the repo (https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart)
4) firebase deploy 

Alot of changes can be made frontend wise, very basic app showing GET request for image/ sending a POST request to API using fetch
